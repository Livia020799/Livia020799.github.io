# Valentine project
This is just something I created from @tnarla https://gist.github.com/tnarla/0c09a11fea366145ba684fe6ebf578c5 repository, by changing and upgrading a bit the code. 

If you just want to see what happens you need to download all the files in the same folder (on your computer) and then execute the index.html one. 

Otherwise, if you want to try and edit the code, I suggest you to use Codepen, where you can edit all the files at the same time and see imeditely what happens to your interactive message.

You can also create a link dierctly to directly host the static webpage with the animation  on GitHub, mine is https://livia020799.github.io/ 

Tutorial on how to create the link on GitHub:
1) Create an account on GitHub
2) Create a new repository
3) Upload the css, js and html files
4) Go to Settings > Pages
5) Select the main branch and click "Save"
6) Refresh the page or come back after a couple of minutes and on top of the "Pages" page you should find the link to your static Webpage

Please feel free to dm me for anything :)
